# Advent Of Rust 2021

This repo tries to implement all the puzzles from the [Advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/).

Each branch solves one puzzle and has a second branch for the second half of each puzzle. All branches are named `puzzle_<no>_<1/2>` where the `<no>` is the puzzle number and `<1|2>` tells which half of the puzzle is solved by this branch.

## Building

Of course, an installed version of rust is needed. With cargo installed, all puzzles should build using
```bash
cargo build     # to build
cargo run       # to run
```

The inputs and outputs of each puzzle are stored in `input.txt` and `output.txt`.

## Puzzle description

--- Part Two ---
The resulting polymer isn't nearly strong enough to reinforce the submarine. You'll need to run more steps of the pair insertion process; a total of 40 steps should do it.

In the above example, the most common element is B (occurring 2192039569602 times) and the least common element is H (occurring 3849876073 times); subtracting these produces 2188189693529.

Apply 40 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?
