# Advent Of Rust 2021

This repo tries to implement all the puzzles from the [Advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/).

Each branch solves one puzzle and has a second branch for the second half of each puzzle. All branches are named `puzzle_<no>_<1/2>` where the `<no>` is the puzzle number and `<1|2>` tells which half of the puzzle is solved by this branch.

## Building

Of course, an installed version of rust is needed. With cargo installed, all puzzles should build using
```bash
cargo build     # to build
cargo run       # to run
```

The inputs and outputs of each puzzle are stored in `input.txt` and `output.txt`.

## Puzzle description

--- Part Two ---
Unfortunately, considering only horizontal and vertical lines doesn't give you the full picture; you need to also consider diagonal lines.

Because of the limits of the hydrothermal vent mapping system, the lines in your list will only ever be horizontal, vertical, or a diagonal line at exactly 45 degrees. In other words:

An entry like 1,1 -> 3,3 covers points 1,1, 2,2, and 3,3.
An entry like 9,7 -> 7,9 covers points 9,7, 8,8, and 7,9.
Considering all lines from the above example would now produce the following diagram:

```
1.1....11.
.111...2..
..2.1.111.
...1.2.2..
.112313211
...1.2....
..1...1...
.1.....1..
1.......1.
222111....
```
You still need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap. In the above example, this is still anywhere in the diagram with a 2 or larger - now a total of 12 points.

Consider all of the lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?
